# Codex Blog Test

This project uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to generate the static site.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the site:

```bash
npm run build
```

The generated site will be placed in the `_site` directory.

To run a local development server with live reload:

```bash
npm start
```
